## It’s not rocket science.

Statslab is a sports statistics and analytics website started as a personal project by Shaheer Sajid, an aerospace engineer from Georgia Tech. The goal of Statslab is to contribute to sports analytics discourse from a unique perspective, adding meaningful insights into the world of sports.

Translation: it’s a personal project for Shaheer to rant about sports.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].

[^1]:a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats.
